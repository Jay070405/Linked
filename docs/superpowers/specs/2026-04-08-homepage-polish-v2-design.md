# Homepage Polish v2 — Design Spec

**Date**: 2026-04-08
**Branch**: `cleanup-pass`
**Status**: Approved design, ready for implementation

---

## Summary

7 enhancements across the homepage scroll experience to eliminate dead zones, add visible interactivity, and bring a premium editorial feel. All effects monochrome (black/white only), visible but restrained.

**Key principle**: Use vanilla CSS/JS for effects where React component abstractions have failed previously. Only use React components (CurvedLoop, ScrollReveal) where they work cleanly. No Three.js/R3F dependencies for these enhancements.

---

## 1. Navigation Polish + Scroll Spy

### Nav Polish
- Add animated underline on hover to desktop nav links — a `::after` pseudo-element that scales from `scaleX(0)` to `scaleX(1)` on hover, white, 1px height
- On scroll (when `scrolled` state is true), add a subtle frosted glass look: increase `backdrop-blur` and add a faint `border-bottom` glow

### Scroll Spy
- New component: `ScrollSpy.tsx` — a fixed vertical dot indicator on the right side of the viewport
- Shows dots for each main section: Hero, Works, Skills, Cinematic, About, Resume, Contact
- Active section highlighted (larger dot, brighter)
- Clicking a dot smooth-scrolls to that section
- Uses `IntersectionObserver` to track which section is in view
- Positioned `right: 24px`, vertically centered, `z-index: 85`
- Dots: 6px circles, `border: 1px solid white/20`, active dot: 8px, `bg-white`, with a subtle glow `box-shadow`
- Hidden on mobile (below `md` breakpoint)

**Files**: `Navigation.tsx` (edit), new `ScrollSpy.tsx`

## 2. Mouse-Tracking Edge Glow on Works Cards

A CSS + vanilla JS effect. No React Bits BorderGlow.

### Implementation
- Create a reusable CSS class `.card-glow` and a small JS utility hook `useCardGlow`
- On `pointermove`, capture mouse position relative to the card
- Set CSS custom properties `--glow-x` and `--glow-y` on the card element
- A `::before` pseudo-element on the card renders a `radial-gradient` at `var(--glow-x) var(--glow-y)` — soft white glow, ~180px radius, opacity 0.15
- On `pointerleave`, fade the glow out (transition opacity to 0)
- The glow sits behind card content but above the card background

### Where to apply
- `WorksShowcase.tsx` — spiral cards on homepage
- `works/page.tsx` — grid cards on works page
- `works/[slug]/page.tsx` — hero image on detail page

**Files**: New `useCardGlow.ts` hook, edit 3 files above, CSS in `globals.css`

---

## 3. CSS Frosted Glass on Cinematic Text

Replace the plain black background behind "BETWEEN IMAGINATION AND REALITY, I BUILD WORLDS." with a frosted glass panel.

### Implementation
- Behind the text content, add a `div.glass-panel` — centered, ~80vw wide, ~40vh tall
- CSS: `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.03)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(120%)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`, `border-radius: 24px`
- Animated gradient border using a rotating `conic-gradient` mask on a `::before` pseudo-element — very subtle white shimmer that rotates slowly (20s loop)
- The glass panel fades in with the text (tied to the existing GSAP timeline at ~0.06) and dissolves out with the text
- Add a faint inner radial glow: `box-shadow: inset 0 0 120px rgba(255,255,255,0.04)`

### Aesthetic
- Must remain monochrome — white glass on near-black
- The effect should be visible but not dominate — the text is hero
- No colored gradients, no purple, no warm tones

**Files**: `CinematicTransition.tsx` (edit), CSS in `globals.css`

---

## 4. Particle Dissolve Transition (Cinematic → About)

Eliminates the dead black gap between CinematicTransition and AboutSection.

### Implementation
- New component: `ParticleDissolve.tsx` — placed between `<CinematicTransition />` and `<AboutSection />` in `HomeExperience.tsx`
- Uses a `<canvas>` element, full viewport, with vanilla JS (no Three.js)
- On scroll into view (ScrollTrigger), the black screen breaks apart into small white particles/noise dots that scatter outward and fade, revealing the AboutSection behind
- Canvas draws ~800 small white dots. As scroll progresses (0→1):
  - 0.0–0.3: dots appear, static noise pattern on black
  - 0.3–0.7: dots scatter outward from center, gaps form, About bg shows through
  - 0.7–1.0: remaining dots fade out, canvas becomes transparent
- `background: transparent` on the canvas so AboutSection shows through the gaps
- Pin distance: `+=1200` — short, punchy transition
- The component has `position: relative` with z-index between Cinematic and About

### Aesthetic
- White dots only, no color
- Particles should feel like dust/noise dissolving, not a fireworks show
- Restrained — 800 particles max, small size (1-3px)

**Files**: New `ParticleDissolve.tsx`, edit `HomeExperience.tsx`

## 5. CurvedLoop Marquee in About Section

Replace the static SVG curves with the React Bits `CurvedLoop` component (already installed at `components/CurvedLoop.jsx`).

### Implementation
- Remove the current `<svg>` animated curves from `AboutSection.tsx`
- Add two `CurvedLoop` instances stacked vertically, low opacity
- Top loop: `marqueeText="WORLDBUILDING · ENVIRONMENT DESIGN · VISUAL DEVELOPMENT · NARRATIVE · ATMOSPHERE · "`, `speed={1.5}`, `direction="left"`
- Bottom loop: same text, `speed={1}`, `direction="right"`, offset vertically
- Container: `opacity: 0.12`, `pointer-events: none` (disable drag interaction — it would conflict with page scroll)
- Font: inherit from site (Cormorant Garamond or the mono font), `fill: white`, small size via className

### Fallback
- If CurvedLoop causes layout issues (it uses a fixed `viewBox="0 0 1440 120"`), fall back to CSS `@keyframes` marquee with the same text on a curved SVG `textPath`

**Files**: `AboutSection.tsx` (edit), import `CurvedLoop`

---

## 6. ScrollReveal on Headings + Key Text

Use the React Bits `ScrollReveal` component (already installed at `components/ScrollReveal.jsx`) for word-by-word reveal.

### Where to apply
- **AboutSection**: Statement heading ("I craft worlds...") — already has ScrollReveal, keep it
- **AboutSection**: Both body paragraphs — wrap each in ScrollReveal with lighter settings (`baseOpacity={0.15}`, `baseRotation={1}`, `blurStrength={2}`)
- **ResumeSection**: Section heading ("Experience & Skills") — wrap in ScrollReveal
- **ContactSection**: Heading ("Let's Connect") + description paragraph — wrap in ScrollReveal

### Settings
- Headings: `baseOpacity={0.08}`, `baseRotation={2}`, `blurStrength={3}`, `enableBlur={true}`
- Body text: `baseOpacity={0.15}`, `baseRotation={1}`, `blurStrength={2}`, `enableBlur={true}`
- All use `scrollContainerRef={null}` (window scroll)

**Files**: `AboutSection.tsx`, `ResumeSection.tsx`, `ContactSection.tsx` (edit)

## 8. LogoSkillsTransition Pacing Rework

The current particle explosion in LogoSkillsTransition is too fast — one scroll tick and the entire sequence is over. The user can't see the particles gather, hold, explode, scatter, and dissolve. The pinned scroll needs to be longer and each phase needs to breathe.

### Problem
- Current pin: `+=3400` with scrub `2.0`
- The explosion phase (scrollProgress ~0.58–0.86) passes too quickly — a single mousewheel flick skips through it
- The hold phase (0.42–0.52) is only 10% of 3400 = 340px of scroll — not enough to appreciate the logo
- Users should feel like they're watching a cinematic moment, not skipping through a flipbook

### Fix
- Increase pin distance to `+=5000` — this is a centerpiece section, it deserves scroll real estate
- Scrub: `1.5` (slightly more responsive than 2.0 but still smooth)
- Rework timeline phases with more generous spacing:
  - **0.00–0.12**: Logo fades in, scales from 0.6 to 1.0
  - **0.12–0.28**: "SKILLS" typewriter text reveals letter by letter
  - **0.28–0.45**: **Hold** — logo + text visible, particles gently breathing/floating. This is 17% = 850px of scroll where the user just absorbs the logo
  - **0.45–0.55**: Text fades out, preparing for explosion
  - **0.55–0.82**: **Particle explosion** — this is the hero moment. 27% = 1350px of scroll. Particles should visibly accelerate outward from the logo shape. The user scrolls and watches particles fly. Should feel like slow-motion detonation, not an instant pop
  - **0.82–0.94**: Particles scatter to edges and fade out, screen goes dark
  - **0.94–1.00**: Dark overlay completes fade to black
- The p5 sketch's `scrollProgress` mapping also needs adjustment to match these new phase boundaries — the explosion trigger point and ramp curve should align with 0.55–0.82

### Key feel
- The hold phase should feel like a pause, a breath — "look at this logo"
- The explosion should feel like slow-motion — each scroll tick moves particles visibly but not all at once
- The fade-out should be graceful, not abrupt

**Files**: `LogoSkillsTransition.tsx` (edit timeline), `P5LogoSkills.tsx` or related p5 sketch (adjust scrollProgress mapping)

## 7. Overall Polish & Consistency

### Section transitions
- Every section should have a soft gradient edge at top: `linear-gradient(180deg, transparent, section-bg 80px)` — using the existing `.section-edge-top` class, ensure it's applied consistently to About, Resume, Contact

### Z-index stacking (already fixed)
- Hero → Works(50) → LogoSkills(55) → Cinematic(60) → ParticleDissolve(62) → About(65) → Resume(70) → Contact(75) → Nav(90)

### Remove dead code
- Delete `BorderGlow.jsx` and `BorderGlow.css` — no longer used anywhere
- Clean up any unused imports from the shadcn install that aren't used

---

## Technical Constraints

- **No Three.js/R3F** for any of these enhancements (FluidGlass stays unused)
- **Vanilla CSS/JS** preferred for visual effects (glow, glass, particles) — more reliable than React component wrappers
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** for scroll-linked animations (already in use)
- **React components** only where they work: CurvedLoop (clean SVG), ScrollReveal (GSAP wrapper)
- **Test in browser after each change** — do not batch visual changes without verification
- **Monochrome only** — black, white, gray. No warm tones, no purple, no colored gradients
